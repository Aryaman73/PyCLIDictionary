# PyCLIDictionary

This is a personal project that is still in progress!

It's meant to be a simple dictionary tool, except it randomly picks a dictionary each time you ask for a definition. (I currently have the Urban Dictionary API and a English JSON dictionary working, more to come). 

Once I have multiple APIs and a polished GUI, I eventually plan on turning this into a game of sorts, or perhaps a chrome extension.
